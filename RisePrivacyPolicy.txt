Only necessary data is transmitted to operate the system.

5.  Data Security We take steps to ensure your data is stored safely,
    including encrypted storage, limited access, and secured

    acknowledge this risk.

6.  Data Sharing Your data may only be shared when:

-   Required by law

You must prove ownership of the HWID or account.

    consent if required by law. We do not knowingly collect data from
    minors under 13 without consent.

    time. Continued use of the script means you accept any changes.

    developer through the official channels of the script.
